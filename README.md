# How To Buy HODLAPE

We highly recommended to NOT use the Crypto.com Defi Wallet for now.

Instead, the <a href="https://metamask.io/">Metamask</a> OR <a href="https://www.tokenpocket.pro/en">Token Pocket</a> are a much better alternative for optimal use.

If any of you have your wallets on the Crypto.com Defi Wallet, you can simply just take your seed phrase and put import your wallet on those said above.

NOTE: <i>If you have multiple wallets with seed phrases, your best to use <a href="https://www.tokenpocket.pro/en">Token Pocket</a> as it will allow you to import multiple seed phrase wallets unlike Metamask which only allows you to import one main account.</i>

# I. <b>Add the CRONOS CR20 network:</b>

- RPC: https://mmf-rpc.xstaking.sg/ <i>(this is a different RPC than the original, this one works better and faster).</i>

- Symbol: CRO

- Chain ID: 25

- Block Explorer: https://cronoscan.com/

# II. <strong>Import OR create a new wallet(s)</strong>

- Metamask only allows you to import or create one main wallet with a seed phrase, but allows you to open multiple wallets under the main wallet.

- Token Pocket allows you to import multiple seed phrase wallets if you already have more than one main wallet.

- Trust Wallet does not support Cronos yet.

# III. Buy CRO

<strong>Buy CRO with fiat (debit/credit card)</strong>

- Head to https://crypto.com

- Buy CRO through wallet with credit or debit card 

<b>NOTE:</b> <i>You may need to wait 24 hours before you can withdraw if you've just added a wallet address to your whitelist so please check that first</i>
