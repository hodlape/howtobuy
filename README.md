# How To Buy HODLAPE

We highly recommended to NOT use the Crypto.com Defi Wallet for now.

Instead, the <a href="https://metamask.io/">Metamask</a> OR <a href="https://www.tokenpocket.pro/en">Token Pocket</a> are a much better alternative for optimal use.

If any of you have your wallets on the Crypto.com Defi Wallet, you can simply just take your seed phrase and put import your wallet on those said above.

NOTE: <i>If you have multiple wallets with seed phrases, your best to use <a href="https://www.tokenpocket.pro/en">Token Pocket</a> as it will allow you to import multiple seed phrase wallets unlike Metamask which only allows you to import one main account.</i>

# I. <b>Add the CRONOS CR20 network:</b>

- RPC: https://mmf-rpc.xstaking.sg/ <i>(this is a different RPC than the original, this one works better and faster).</i>

- Symbol: CRO

- Chain ID: 25

- Block Explorer: https://cronoscan.com/

# II. <strong>Import OR create a new wallet(s)</strong>

- Metamask only allows you to import or create one main wallet with a seed phrase, but allows you to open multiple wallets under the main wallet.

- Token Pocket allows you to import multiple seed phrase wallets if you already have more than one main wallet.

- Trust Wallet does not support Cronos yet.

# III. Buy CRO

<strong>Buy CRO with fiat (debit/credit card)</strong>

- Head to https://crypto.com

- Make an account and add your debit/credit card.

- Buy CRO through wallet with credit or debit card 

<b>NOTE:</b> <i>You may need to wait 24 hours before you can withdraw if you've just added a wallet address to your whitelist so please check that first</i>

- And withdraw to your desired wallet

<strong>Bridge to CRONOS</strong>

- https://app.xy.finance/
- Select your native network and connect your wallet.
- Select the currency in your native network (BNB, ETH USDT USDC ETC...)
- in the swap to ta select the CRO network and the currency you want (CRO)
- and finally the amount your sending over and submit your transaction <i>(remember to have the gas fees required in your native original currency & this should take around 5 mins as it has a few swaps to jump through)</i>

From here once you recieve your converted token on the Cronos network, you can now buy CRO with it. on https://mm.finance.

# IV. Buy HODLAPE

- Grab the HodlApe contract address: <code>0x2E82f79181C9D9AECfC6fAF6A42dfFA7A4197Efa</code> OR you can use thie link below <i>(just make sure you paste the contract address to import the token in the swap)</i>
- Head to https://mm.finance/swap?outputCurrency=0x2e82f79181c9d9aecfc6faf6a42dffa7a4197efa <i>That link will auto add the coin for you</i>
